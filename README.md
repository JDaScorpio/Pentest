# Pentest
The proposed project aims to create a comprehensive simulated corporate network environment within a VMWare virtual machine for conducting realistic digital forensic 
investigations. The simulated network will consist of multiple virtual machines running both Windows and Kali Linux operating systems, mimicking the diverse environment 
typically found in corporate settings.

Scenario 1: Metasploit Reverse Shell and Network Traffic Analysis
In this scenario, I will use Metasploit on a Kali Linux virtual machine to exploit a vulnerability and establish a reverse shell connection with a Windows virtual machine 
within the simulated corporate network. Wireshark will be used to capture and analyze the network traffic during the attack, enabling me to detect and investigate the reverse 
shell connection. The goal is to identify the initial attack vector, analyze the reverse shell payload, and document the attacker's activities and potential data exfiltration 
attempts.

Scenario 2: DDoS Attack and Network Traffic Analysis
This will simulate a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack on a Windows virtual machine within the simulated corporate network, using a Kali Linux virtual machine as 
the attacking system. Wireshark will be employed to capture and analyze the network traffic during the attack, allowing me to detect potential DDoS activities and investigate 
the source and impact of the attack.

Scenario 3: Memory Forensics and Malware Analysis
In this scenario, it will use FTK Imager to acquire and analyze memory dumps from compromised Windows virtual machines within the simulated network. The goal is to detect the 
presence of rootkits, malware, or other malicious software that may have been installed during simulated attacks. I will learn how to interpret and document findings from 
memory forensics analysis, uncovering critical evidence and understanding the extent of the compromise.

Scenario 4: Phishing Email, Credential Theft, and Data Hiding
This simulation will create a phishing email using tools like Ngrok, tricking a simulated victim into clicking a malicious link and revealing their login credentials. 
Acting as an attacker, participants will then attempt to hide these stolen credentials within an image file on a Kali Linux virtual machine. I will then use FTK imager 
to conduct forensic analysis on the image file, aiming to detect and recover the hidden data. This scenario will challenge my skills in social engineering, data obfuscation,
and forensic data recovery techniques.
